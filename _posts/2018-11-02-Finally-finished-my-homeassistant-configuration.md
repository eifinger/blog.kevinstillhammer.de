More and more people start to ask me what software I use for my smart home system.
<!--more-->
I started of with some scripts in nodeJS and Python to control 433Mhz Sockets and tried to embed them in a webpage so I can have nice little buttons to click.
Turns out I am not a frontend developer and will never be, it looked horrible and I had no real fun in doing it.

In my search for a nice frontend to control my Smart Home I came across [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/), [iobroker](http://iobroker.net/) and finally [Home-Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). Out of the three I liked the UI of Home-Assistant the most and gave it a go.

## Homeassistant

Yes, I initially chose my Smart Home System on which I spend many hours because I thought it looked nice! :D

I am very glad that after all this years I can say that this was a good decision.

Home-Assistant has a great community, is easy to get started and gives me everything and every component I can ask for. It's fun!

## Now back to the question I get asked all of the time

*What system and what devices are you using?*

Until know I could only answer one part of it:

I use [Home-Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [Appdaemon](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to control all my devices.

But today I finally finished the documentation of my Homeassistant Configuration which also consists of all the devices I use.
It is based on the great documentation of [CCOSTAN](https://github.com/CCOSTAN/Home-AssistantConfig/blob/master/README.md) and you can can find it here:
