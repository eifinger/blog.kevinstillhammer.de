## Hi there 👋

I learnt programming with ☕ Java, done professional work in the dotnet space and learned 🐍 Python in order to contribute to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and give back.

Currently mostly using Python and Kotlin and trying to learn 🦀 Rust.

I am maintaining integrations on Home Assistant 🏡 :

* [HERE Travel Time](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/here_travel_time/)
* [Google Travel Time](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_travel_time/)
* [Waze Travel Time](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/waze_travel_time/)
* [Kraken](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/kraken/)

And a few custom integrations for Home Assistant 🏡 :

* [Weenect](https://github.com/eifinger/hass-weenect)
* [Fressnapf Tracker](https://github.com/eifinger/hass-fressnapf-tracker)
* [Folding@Home](https://github.com/eifinger/hass-foldingathomecontrol)

I am also maintaining the GitHub Actions:

* [astral-sh/setup-uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv)
* [astral-sh/ruff-action](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action)
* [eifinger/setup-rye](https://github.com/eifinger/setup-rye)
